    "For this project, we had access to 4,377 labelled tweets.  It is highly likely that model performance could be improved if the labelled dataset was significantly expanded.  Given the appropriate time and resources, it is recommended that this is done prior to deploying the model.  \n",

    "\n",
    "This model considered tweets individually.  However, tweets are often part of a longer conversation between a service agent and a customer.  It may be useful to broaden the model to consider original tweets alongside any replies.  This would help operators understand how many tweets and how much time was required to resolve an issue/question.  This is a crucial component of customer service.  \n",
