# Improving Customer Service through Tweet Classification

## Abstract

## Background

### Mobile Operators & Customer Satisfaction 

In the UK, there are only 4 mobile operators that own and operate network infrastructure.  These are:

- EE
- O2
- Three
- Vodafone

As of 2018, these giants accounted for 87% of all subscribers<sup>1</sup>.  With the remaing 13% subscribing to a variety of different virtual networks that 'piggyback' off the infrastructure of the major players.  These include companies like  GiffGaff, Plusnet and Tesco Mobile.

However, in spite of their dominance, the 'big four' rate poorly in relation to the smaller virtual network operators.  A recent survey by Which?<sup>2</sup> asked customers to rate mobile providers on four criteria:

- Customer Service
- Ease of Contacting
- Value for Money
- Incentives

The results revealed that O2, EE and Vodafone occupied the bottom three places, whilst Three ranked a mediocre 8 out of 13.

|Rank   |Mobile Network Provider |
| :---: | :--------------------  |
| 1     | Giffgaff               |
| 2     | Utility Warehouse      |
| 3     | Plusnet Mobile         |
| 4     | Tesco Mobile           |
| 5     | Asda Mobile            |
| 6     | Sky Mobile             |
| 7     | ID Mobile              |
| 8     | Three                  |
| 9     | BT Mobile              |
| 10    | Virgin Mobile          |
| 11    | O2                     |
| 12    | EE                     |
| 13    | Vodafone               |

It is therefore clear that the major networks need to take action to improve the level of satisfaction amongst their customers.  Any complacency will likely weaken their position in the market. 


### Twitter as a Platform for Customer Support

Increasingly, customers are turning to Twitter to for support.  The chart below plots this phenomenon.

This turn to "social customer care" is unsuprising.  Twitter is public.  It facilitates a one-to-one interaction between customer and company, but with the added pressure (to the company) of an audience.  

Twitter therefore provides companies with an amazing opportunity to publicly demonstrate their ability to serve customers well.  A 2016 study by Twitter<sup>3</sup> illustrates the dividends that this can pay.  It found that 96% of users who used Twitter to contact a company for customer service, and then had a positive experience, would buy from the business again.  Moreover, 83% of them would recommend that brand to others.  

The emergence of Twitter as a customer care tool therefore provides the major mobile network operators with an important opportunity to improve their ratings.  

## Business Case

Given the above, the purpose of this project is to provide mobile network operators with a tool to help them exploit the potential of Twitter, and thereby increase their standing in the eyes of the customer.   

This will be achieved through a model which, enables tweets to be categorised according to:

1. **Subject** (e.g. network, device, customer service etc.)
2. **Sentiment** (e.g. positive, neutral, negative)

This will help businesses to:

- Efficiently handle pre-categorised tweets
- Provide an on-the-pulse measure of customer satisfaction
- Identify key areas for service improvement


## Project Approach

The **OSEMN framework** has been used to structure this project.  This approach guides the data scientist through the five key stages of a data science project:

1. **O**btain Data
2. **S**crub Data
3. **E**xplore Data
4. **M**odel Data
5. i**N**terpret Results

The following five subsections summarise the approach to each stage.  For each section, a link is provided to an annotated Jupyter workbook in which more detail can be found.
