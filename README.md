## Background

### Mobile Operators & Customer Satisfaction 

In the UK, there are only 4 mobile operators that own and operate network infrastructure.  These are:

- EE
- O2
- Three
- Vodafone

As of 2018, these giants accounted for 87% of all subscribers<sup>1</sup>.  With the remaing 13% subscribing to a variety of different virtual networks that 'piggyback' off the infrastructure of the major players.  These include companies like  GiffGaff, Plusnet and Tesco Mobile.

However, in spite of their dominance, the 'big four' rate poorly in relation to the smaller virtual network operators.  A recent survey by Which?<sup>2</sup> asked customers to rate mobile providers on four criteria:

- Customer Service
- Ease of Contacting
- Value for Money
- Incentives

The results revealed that O2, EE and Vodafone occupied the bottom three places, whilst Three ranked a mediocre 8 out of 13.

|Rank   |Mobile Network Provider |
| :---: | :--------------------: |
| 1     | Giffgaff               |
| 2     | Utility Warehouse      |
| 3     | Plusnet Mobile         |
| 4     | Tesco Mobile           |
| 5     | Asda Mobile            |
| 6     | Sky Mobile             |
| 7     | ID Mobile              |
| 8     | Three                  |
| 9     | BT Mobile              |
| 10    | Virgin Mobile          |
| 11    | O2                     |
| 12    | EE                     |
| 13    | Vodafone               |

It is therefore clear that the major networks need to take action to improve the level of satisfaction amongst their customers.  Any complacency will likely weaken their position in the market.
